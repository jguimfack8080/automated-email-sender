# Automated Email Sender

**Project Overview**:  
`automated-email-sender` is a Python-based project designed to send bulk emails with attachments using a Gmail account. The project enables users to send emails to a list of recipients, attaching files from a specific directory, while ensuring that the email content is read from a provided message file. This project includes functionalities for logging email actions, ensuring no duplicate emails are sent, cleaning email lists for duplicate entries, and supporting multiple attachments from specified directories.

## Project Features

- **Bulk Email Sending**: Send emails to a list of recipients with attachments.
- **Attachment Handling**: Supports adding multiple attachments from a specified directory, excluding sensitive files (e.g., credentials).
- **Message Management**: Email content (subject and body) is read from a provided text file. The subject line is extracted from the message file under the keyword `Betreff:`.
- **Log Generation**: Logs every email sent (successes and failures) for tracking purposes. Includes detailed timestamps of each email sent.
- **Duplicate Email Prevention**: Ensures that emails are not sent multiple times to the same recipient by checking the Gmail sent folder.
- **Email List Cleaning**: Provides functionality to clean up and remove duplicate email addresses from a list of recipients and save the cleaned list to a new file prefixed with `cleaned_`.
- **SMTP and IMAP Integration**: Uses Gmailâ€™s SMTP and IMAP servers to send emails and verify that emails are not resent.

## Project Structure

This project consists of the following components:

1. **`send_mail.py`**:  
   The core script that handles the bulk sending of emails with attachments to the recipients provided in the input file. It checks if an email has already been sent to avoid duplication, handles multiple attachments, and generates a log of email sending activity. 
   - Key improvements: The email subject is extracted from the provided message file, and attachments are handled dynamically from the specified directory.

2. **`clean_double_mail.py`**:  
   A script that cleans up an email list by removing duplicate entries. It ensures that the recipient list is unique and sorted alphabetically, saving the cleaned list to a new file prefixed with `cleaned_`.

3. **Log Directory**:  
   The project automatically creates a `Logs` directory where logs of email sending activity are saved. The logs include timestamps and indicate whether emails were successfully sent or failed.

4. **`Docs/[attachments]/credentials`**:  
   Directory containing email credentials, including email address and password for logging into the Gmail account.
